Use web service to:
-return the list of spaces
-get logos/colors
-get name/description


For 1.5 today, youâ€™re ~ limited to what the /sys/info /sys/config and /sys/basic calls return for a space unless you do your own query/counting based off of other /datasets and /collections calls. We could add  something like # downloads to what /sys/info returns, but that would be server-side.
